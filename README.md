A wiki for minecraft, each user can login and sign-up than update info, create his own pages, and custom the page  

## User actions

2. Create pages
3. Update his own pages
4. Comment under pages  

## Page creation 
In page creation can be added up to 3 Images, those won't be changable, `In page paragraphers and in comments you can use a simplified version of MD.`  
Each page has as many paragrapher as needed, however after a page has been created you can no longer add 
 paragraphers, also you can't change the page title,
  __this is because a page has views__ so it should not be modified to much after his creation, still you can change titles to paragraphers.
